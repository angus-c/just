Successful email marketing strategy development considers you know about your clients much more than just their email address. You also need to be aware of their tastes and expectations. That is the only way to make them loyal to your brand. In this article we are going to disclose useful tips that can help you personalize newsletter and make it engaging for your clients.

Personalization is important as template letters do not sell well, they even barely get read. In order to make an efficient personalized newsletter you need to address client by name, consider his current location and offer the products he needs here and now.

Personalized emails should contain relevant information for the subscriber. You can set personalized data in the letter using tags.

So what do you need to do to start using email marketing personalization techniques? The answer is obvious: you need to gather data about your clients and make relevant letters.

According to Experian research 69% of users are willing to provide personal data if it is going to be used to make service better for them. However, in practice the more there are fields in the subscription form (especially the mandatory ones), the smaller is the number of users that fill it.

So how can you collect information about clients and use it for you good afterwards? Modern statistical tools allow you to gather all the necessary data while advanced email marketing services allow you to segmentate and interpret them. Using combination of these tools allows you to significantly improve quality of your newsletter personalization.

Let’s see which user data you can acquire using analytical tools and how to exploit this data.

## Behaviour-Based Personalization

This is one of the most efficient ways of personalization in marketing. After you study the pages someone has visited, the time he sent on the website, how many sections he has looked through, whether he has used the search and what he was searching for, you can develop an efficient personalized letter.

Imagine that client has spent a long time choosing the bicycle and even bought one. After the purchase he has visited a category page with accessories and left the website. In case he gets an email with the list of helmets and locks for the bike he is likely to buy something.

Most of the email marketers use Google Analytics tool to study behaviour of their clients.

So you need to find out:

- How long did the client’s session on your website lasted?
- How many pages did he look through?
- What did he buy?
- What is the share of new visitors?
- What is the bounce rate?
- How much did you earn on each single client who has came from the mailing?

## ROI Calculation

ROIis an indicator you can use to define the efficiency of your newsletter in scope of income/expenditures. In order to get a proper coefficient one has to consider sales data from each letter sent.

Based on ROI you can estimate efficiency of different types of newsletters. In case ROI is less than 1 the campaign is recognized failed. However, if you do everything right you are likely to get a much better result.

You can consider newsletter to be successful if the ROI is 2 or more. This indicator is a good decision-making tool allowing you to make financially grounded changes to your email marketing strategy.

## Click and Opening Based Personalization

Click statistics shows the followed links and the number of clicks made by your subscribers. This allows to estimate clients’ activity and figure out their needs. For example, if you have sent newsletter to the women under 30 and there were 2 links in it (one leading to the category with family goods and another to the beauty products) you will find out what interests them the most from the click statistics.

## Click Heat Map

Click heat map helps you to analyze statistics on page scrolling. It looks like a weather map, however, instead of the highest and lowest temperature you see the colour marking for the clicks distribution.

This technology allows email marketer to define which elements of the mailing have attracted subscribers the most.

## Opening Statistics

Opening statistics also helps personalizing newsletters. Each time you send letters to your clients it is vital to know whether they open letters or not. If not, that means the subject line is not catchy enough. In such a case you need to analyze the statistics and personalize a letter for the customer.

## Personalization by Device

You also should consider making personalization by device used. Monitoring the gadgets used by customers to read your letters can be a good way to make a more personalized offer and segmentate customers by device - for example, Android and Apple users.

## Conclusion

Personalization demands vast efforts you, however, if done properly it can increase your conversion dramatically.
