It is likely you do not mind getting such a ROI for your small business email marketing campaign. Thus, we decided to make this simple guide.

## Write ‘alt’ and ‘title’ for Images

MarketingCharts agency has derived that usually we get up to 400 business emails per month. Letters that have images can help you catch more attention especially if you manage to take a good one which can cause an emotional reaction from the subscriber.

However, it is necessary to consider that almost the half of all letters are opened on the mobile devices. Although mobile devices provide faster response, small monitors not always are fit for proper image display. Thus, if the recipient opens letter only to see the blocked image he will barely be satisfied by your letter. The more often it happens, the harder it is going to be to make a positive reputation of you as a valuable sender.
