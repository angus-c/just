Some of the major email service providers have special requirements to the email addresses. For example, Yahoo email address should start with a character, not a number. Moreover, sometimes there can be mistakes in your mailing list (for example, an absence of the @ in the email address).

Thus in order, to make sure all of the emails in your base correspond to the approved syntax and formatting verification service provides a check. This is a zero level action which has to be done first.

## Domain Confirmation

After the first step is completed it is time to check the validity of the DNS records for the specified domain name. Email verification service checks whether the mail exchange is able to accept letters.

## Mailbox Validation

The last step of email address verification considers enforcement of SMTP protocol in order to validate the mailbox and make sure it exists and able to receive letters. The best services make it even without sending test letters.
