First and foremost, email validation will save you and your customers a lot of time. You probably came across websites that would tell you if you entered a wrong email address when you tried to sign up. This is where email API is employed. Now, imagine your website has no such feature. Your customer makes a mistake in his/her email address or a shipping address without noticing it, places an order, and the entire order tracking process goes downhill, resulting in your customer not getting his/her order and you having to spend time on figuring this out. Sounds like a loss, doesn’t it? An integrated email API will detect such mistakes at the point of placing the order or sign up and will make sure your customers enter only valid details before your system accepts the order and initiates shipping. You will also save costs of re-assigning jobs for staff, wasted postage, and other resources.

Another huge advantage of real-time email verification is that you can also catch user typos from the point of signing up and prompt the user to fix them before completing the registration. This ensures that only real email addresses get registered and increases the number of potential customers.

Email validation API is a completely automated process and doesn’t require any manual handling. It is an integrated feature your customers may not even guess about. However, it creates an overall positive experience when your customers are interacting with your website. If customers have good shopping experience, not only they will come back, they will also spread the word about you. These are small elements of any business that clump up to improve your brand loyalty and nurture the customer relationship, which in turn increases sales.

You could potentially manage your business without an email validation API. However, using email validation API not only shows that you care about your customer, but it is also an indicator that you keep up with the latest technologies and are contemporary with the way you run your business.
