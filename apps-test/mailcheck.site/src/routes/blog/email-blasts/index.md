Ever wondered what an email blast is? Well, someone may call it an email campaign, which it is to a certain degree. An email blast, in its essence, is an unpersonalized email sent to a large number of subscribers. An email blast is used to target all your subscribers at once with the ultimate goal to draw traffic to your site or increase sales. The recipients of an email blast are not typically targeted in a strategic manner.

An email blast is probably no longer the best email marketing practice, as many email marketers would say, and often such emails end up in your subscriber’s spam folder. The ultimate purpose is to create a single message that would be useful to every subscriber in your email list. Now think about nearly 4 billion email users around the world and the different tastes, desires, and goals they have. That being said, sending out one single email to all the contacts in your email list indiscriminately will most likely not bring the desired results. Moreover, it can potentially harm your business in the following ways:

1.  Your unsubscribe rate will increase dramatically (which is not something you expect your email campaign to bring you).
2.  Having a significant bounce rate will compromise the credibility of your email marketing campaign in particular and your business overall.

So what must one do in order to avoid the above consequences and have their email blast work out for the best? We have assembled four essential steps to help your email blast, or email campaign, get delivered, and bring some meaningful results.

The number one task to tackle is to **sort through your email database.** Whether you want it or not, some emails are fake and have no real readers behind them. However, there certainly is a way to eliminate those in your email database. So before launching an email marketing campaign and sending out email blasts, you need to screen through your email database first in order to keep your bounce rate at zero. For this purpose, we have created [Mailcheck](https://www.mailcheck.co/#features) - a state-of-the-art email validation tool, that employs refined algorithms to validate the authenticity of the email addresses in your database. One of the Mailcheck distinctive features is that aside from automatic search and validation, it also conducts manual moderation. Keep in mind, that the larger your list grows, the more important it is to rely on dependable and fast email validation service. Therefore, with the algorithms refined by time and experience, it now takes us only 15 minutes to validate one million email addresses.

Validating your email database must be the first and foremost task to do, because:1. You don’t want any fake emails to constitute your future email lists and further on add an extra step into your marketing routine. 2. You want to eliminate this step from the outset of your email marketing campaign, once and forever.

Next step - **create (a.k.a. clean up) your email list.** Email list cleaning is all about removing inactive and inaccurate emails from your list. This also involves removing your unsubscribers. This may sound like an extra step, which can be put aside until better times. However, if not handled properly and on time, it can cause you troubles, such as being banned by Gmail from sending out emails to its users.

Next and equally important step - **segment your email list.** An email blast at its core is designed to target a large number of people, and personalizing it wouldn’t be much possible if at all. However, segmenting your email list can provide a similar effect. Email segmentation is dividing the subscribers in your email list by age, gender, region, interests, purchase history, etc. For instance, a pet store won’t be sending its cat owners an email about dog carriers sale.

Last but not least - **your email must include a clear call to action.** It is important to understand that having your subscribers open your email doesn’t mean the job is done. It is just a drop in the bucket on the way to accomplishing the final goal. Having a clear understanding of what you want your subscribers to ultimately do will shape the call-to-action you will put in your email.

One last and already mentioned thing, an email blast is probably no longer the best email marketing practice, and the reason to that rests primarily in the term “blast” itself (there are multiple debates why “blast” is not the best term for an email campaign). Our advice - rethink the idea of an email blast at its core. In the end, you’re not blasting your recipients; you are providing them with valuable content that may persuade them to pay for your service or product.
