## just-random

Part of a [library](https://anguscroll.com/just) of zero-dependency npm modules that do just do one thing.
Guilt-free utilities for every occasion.

[`🍦 Try it`](https://anguscroll.com/just/just-random)

```shell
npm install just-random
```
```shell
yarn add just-random
```

Return a randomly selected element in an array

```js
import random from 'just-random';

random([1, 2, 3]);
// one of [1, 2, 3], at random
```
