## just-reduce-object

Part of a [library](https://anguscroll.com/just) of zero-dependency npm modules that do just do one thing.
Guilt-free utilities for every occasion.

[`🍦 Try it`](https://anguscroll.com/just/just-reduce-object)

```shell
npm install just-reduce-object
```
```shell
yarn add just-reduce-object
```

Reduce an object

```js
import reduce from 'just-reduce-object';

// applies a function against an accumulator and each key-value pairs of the object
// to reduce it to a single value
reduce({a: 3, b: 5, c: 9}, (acc, key, value, index, keys) => {
  acc[value] = key;
  return acc;
}, {}); // {3: 'a', 5: 'b', 9: 'c'}

reduce({a: 3, b: 5, c: 9}, (acc, key, value, index, keys) => {
  acc += value;
  return acc;
}); // 17
```
