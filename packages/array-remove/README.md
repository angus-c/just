Part of a [library](https://anguscroll.com/just) of zero-dependency npm modules that do just do one thing.
Guilt-free utilities for every occasion.

npm install just-remove
```
```shell
yarn add just-remove
```

Removes one array from another

```js
import remove from 'just-remove';

remove([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [1, 3, 6]); // [2, 4, 5]
```
