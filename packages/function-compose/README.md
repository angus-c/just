## just-compose

Part of a [library](https://anguscroll.com/just) of zero-dependency npm modules that do just do one thing.
Guilt-free utilities for every occasion.

[`üç¶ Try it`](https://anguscroll.com/just/just-compose)

```shell
npm install just-compose
```
```shell
yarn add just-compose
```

Return a function composed of 2 or more functions

```js
import compose from 'just-compose';

const sqRootBiggest = compose(Math.max, Math.sqrt, Math.trunc);
sqRootBiggest(10, 5); // 3
sqRootBiggest(7, 0, 16); // 4
```
