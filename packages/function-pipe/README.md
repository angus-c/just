## just-pipe

Part of a [library](https://anguscroll.com/just) of zero-dependency npm modules that do just do one thing.
Guilt-free utilities for every occasion.

[`🍦 Try it`](https://anguscroll.com/just/just-pipe)

```shell
npm install just-pipe
```
```shell
yarn add just-pipe
```

Pass a value through a pipeline of functions

```js
import pipe from 'just-pipe

pipe(3, a => a+1, b => b*2) // 8
pipe('John Smith', a => a.split(' '), b => b.reverse(), c => c[0]) // 'Smith'
```
