## just-sort-by

Part of a [library](https://anguscroll.com/just) of zero-dependency npm modules that do just do one thing.
Guilt-free utilities for every occasion.

[`🍦 Try it`](https://anguscroll.com/just/just-sort-by)

```shell
npm install just-sort-by
```
```shell
yarn add just-sort-by
```

Produces a new array, sorted in ascending order

```js
import sortBy from 'just-array-sort-by';

sortBy([10, 1, 5, 20, 15, 35, 30, 6, 8]); // [1, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 30, 35]

sortBy([
  {user: 'fabio', details: {city: "Milan", age: 34}},
  {user: 'max', details: {city: "Munich", age: 29}},
  {user: 'zacarias', details: {city: "Sao Paulo", age: 44}},
  {user: 'robert', details: {city: "Manchester", age: 28}},
  {user: 'klaus', details: {city: "Zurich", age: 38}},
], function(o) {
  return o.details.age;
});

/*
