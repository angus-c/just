## just-union

Part of a [library](https://anguscroll.com/just) of zero-dependency npm modules that do just do one thing.
Guilt-free utilities for every occasion.

[`🍦 Try it`](https://anguscroll.com/just/just-union)

```shell
npm install just-union
```
```shell
yarn add just-union
```

Returns the union of two arrays

```js
import union from 'just-union';

union([1, 2, 5, 6], [2, 3, 4, 6]); // [1, 2, 5, 6, 3, 4]
```
