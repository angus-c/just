## just-random-integer

Part of a [library](https://anguscroll.com/just) of zero-dependency npm modules that do just do one thing.
Guilt-free utilities for every occasion.

```shell
npm install just-random-integer
```
```shell
yarn add just-random-integer

Produces an integer between two values

```js
import random from 'just-random';

random();
// Produces a random number between 0 and 1

random(5);

random(5, 10);
// Produces a random number between 5 and 10
```
